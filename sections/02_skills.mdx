### Things I can do

Here are just a few of the systems and skills I’m praticed with. I love [building
tools I and others can use](#three), and I use those projects as an opportunity
to explore systems I’m unfamiliar with.

<ul className="feature-icons">
    {props.resume.skills.map((skill, i) => (
        <Skill
            skill={skill}
            key={skill.name}
        />
    ))}
</ul>
